# FINM 33165 Final Project

Group:
* Vedant Pathak
* Felix Glombitza
* Deyu Zhang
* Keyi Wang

## Layout

Recall that this project is a variation on something I had tested out earlier -- using DDQNs to trade a single pair of securities based on momentum indicators. My writeup and existing code are inside `presentation/reference_material`.

All code used to train the model and evaluate its performance will be written inside `src`. Specifically:
* `src/agent` contains all code used to define the trading environment and training loop.
* `src/portfolio_eval` contains all code used to evaluate trading performance.
